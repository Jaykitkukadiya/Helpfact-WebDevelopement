# Helpfact

•	The aim was to establish a connection between two users located far away from each other in case of an emergency situation when there were no other modes of communication available (internet/ phone call).
•	Platform takes help from the locals located nearby the other person’s location where communication is available.
•	User assigns the task to the locals via a platform to find that person and give them a message which that local received from the user via task.
•	Locals are joined to the platform for earning purpose and on completion of each task, they get rewarded, and the platform gets some commission.
